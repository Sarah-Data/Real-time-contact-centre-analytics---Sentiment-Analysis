Real-time contact centre analytics - using sentiment analysis of audio only, transcript only and/or both to improve customer experience.
Sometimes, it could be particularly difficult to track and perform service recovery for customers who had bad experiences on the call, except on the odd instance where the customer or agent volunteered feedback.
A ton of customers have encountered a negative experience with a contact center rep when seeking information or trying to resolve an issue with a product or service. The representative might not have provided the right responses, leaving you frustrated. 
Now, imagine if a few minutes later, the customer receives another call or message apologizing for the inconvenience and being provided with the information or resolution needed? How would he/she feel?
This kind of near real-time service recovery can make a significant difference in customer experience and satisfaction delivered by this channel.
